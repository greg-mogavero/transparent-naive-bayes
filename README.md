## Overview
This project is meant to serve as an educational tool for me and anyone else who wants to understand how Naive Bayes classifiers are implemented in code. My goal is to clearly document each step of the algorithm, including the underlying math as much as possible. Furthermore, I will try to keep the code as simple and easy-to-understand as possible, sacrificing performance and robustness if necessary.

## Requirements
- Python 3.6
